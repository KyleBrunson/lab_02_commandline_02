==========
We're going to practice downloading files from a web site.  We'll use this practice to download more lab materials!
==========
==========
8. Now let's try downloading a file from a web site.  Type in the URL *exactly* as is: google.com.

$ curl google.com

Copy and paste the output below.
----------

10. That's great, but what if I want to save the file?  What flag/option and option argument would I use to download the page to a file called google.html?  Run it to download the URL www.google.com.

Write the command you used below.  Also copy and paste the output below.
----------

$ curl -o google.html www.google.com


==========
11. Now let's download the lab file for this homework.  First, figure out what directory you're in.

Write the command you used to determine your directory.  Also, copy and paste the output below.
----------

$ pwd
/c/Users/Kizzle


==========
12. If you're not in your home directory, change to it (use the shortcut).

Write the command that you used to change to your home directory.  If you were already in your home directory, write the command that you *would* have used to change to it!
----------

cd ~

==========
13. So... the lab materials are located at this url:

http://foureyes.github.io/mtec1002-spring2014/labs/02/mtec1002-lab-02.zip

Download the file using curl... to a file called mtec1002-lab-02.zip using the commandline.  

REMEMBER to use the -o flag, and follow it with a .zip extension! 

Use ls to verify that it downloaded.

Write down the command that you used to download the file below.  Additionally, write the output of the command below.
----------

$ curl -o mtec1002-lab-02.zip http://foureyes.github.io/mtec1002-spring2014/labs/02/mtec1002-lab-02.zip

==========
14. We learned a command to uncompress a .zip file.  Use it to extract the files and folders from the file you just downloaded.

Write down the command that you used to uncompress the file.
----------



==========
15. Change to the directory that was just created.  List the contents (of the directory that was extracted from the labs .zip file). 

Copy and paste the output below.
----------



==========
We're going to mess around with archiving and compressing files.  We'll make a directory with a file in it... archive and compress it.... and uncompress it elsewhere.
==========
==========
16. Go back up to your home directory.  Create a directory called stuff.  List the contents of your home directory to prove that the directory was created.

Copy and paste the output below.

22. Move stuff.tar.gz into the lab directory that we downloaded.  We didn't learn this command yet, so just type in exactly as is:

$ mv stuff.tar.gz mtec1002-lab-02 

MAKE SURE YOU MOVE THE FILE THAT ENDS IN .gz!

Change your directory to mtec1002-lab-02.  

List the files.  Copy and paste the output below (stuff.tar.gz should be there).

==========
24. Go back to your home directory
[No output]
----------



==========
25. Download and uncompress this file using curl and tar -xvf in your home directory:

http://foureyes.github.io/mtec1002/labs/02/secret.tar.gz

REMEMBER to use the -o flag and specifiy a filenmae that ends in .tar.gz

Write out the commands that you used to do this.
